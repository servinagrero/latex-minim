# latex-minim

Minimal latex template designed for theses and dissertations.

# Why

I tried to use the tufte, but the source code is pretty much a mess. This
template is the result of trying to recreate the same template up to a extent
while creating maintainable code.

# License

The template uses the MIT license. Please see the file [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) in the main directory of the repository for more details.
